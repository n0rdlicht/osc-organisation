## prompt ChatGPT
Act like a tutor and treat me like a complete beginner: I want to extract the number of windows from an IFC file using ifcopenshell. 
I provide an IFC file and expect a csv file with the results. 
The csv file should be stored in the same folder as the IFC file. 
I have no libraries nor a code editor installed yet. 
Eventually, write the code so I can copy paste it. 
Tell me how to run the code and how to input the location of the IFC file on mac and on windows. 
Cluster your response in the three chapters installation, code and execution.
