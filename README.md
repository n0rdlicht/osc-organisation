# events
### objectives
The aim of our events is to give those who design, build and maintain our built environment the opportunity to work with cutting-edge technologies and their developers. We want to achieve a good mix of students and professionals, non-coders and coders. The focus is on cooperation between the participants, breaking down fears of contact and building up the energy that is generated during such a hacker weekend.
