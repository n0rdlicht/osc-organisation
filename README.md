## project "Data Management for AEC Professionals" (Max)
### about
Data is becoming more and more important in our professional lives. At the same time, most practitioners in the AECO industry do not have a background in data or software engineering. To give people a help for a better understanding, we bring together the most relevant concepts of data management and enrich it with practical tips from industry experts.
The project can grow over time by continously adding examples and practical tips.

# events
### objectives
The aim of our events is to give those who design, build and maintain our built environment the opportunity to work with cutting-edge technologies and their developers. We want to achieve a good mix of students and professionals, non-coders and coders. The focus is on cooperation between the participants, breaking down fears of contact and building up the energy that is generated during such a hacker weekend.
